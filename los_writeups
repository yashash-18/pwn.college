level-1 (gremlin):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named id.
  -> where id=' or 1=1-- , so that it returns true.
  -> the level is cleared..

level-2 (cobolt):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named id.
  -> where id=admin'-- , so that it returns true since only admins are allowed.
  -> the level is cleared..

level-3 (goblin):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named no.
  -> where no=0 or id=(hex form of admin) . here u can give any number other than 1 since guest matches with "1".

level-4 (orc):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named pw.
  -> where pw=' or 1=1-- , this return the first half true in source code.
  -> lets check the length of the password.
  -> where pw=' or 1=1 and length(pw)>10-- , if it returns anything then it is true else it is false.
  -> now lets take pw=' or 1=1 and substring(pw,1,1)='a'-- 
  -> open burpsuite and on bruteforcing we will get the password .
  -> now enter pw=095a9852
  -> the level is cleared.

level-5 (wolfman):
  -> inspect the page and in the url add pw.

  -> now enter pw=7b751aec
  -> the level is cleared.

level-8 (troll):

level-9 (vampire):
  -> inspect the page and add a parameter named id.
  -> since if we enter admin then it gets replaced by "". ( an empty space)

  -> the level is cleared..

level-10 (skeleton):
  ->
